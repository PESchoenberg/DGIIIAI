The Delta-glider is the ideal ship for the novice pilot to get spaceborne. Its futuristic design concept, high thrust and extremely low fuel consumption make it easy to achieve orbit, and it can even be used for interplanetary travel. The winged design provides aircraft-like handling in the lower atmosphere, while the vertically mounted hover-thrusters allow vertical takeoffs and landings independent of atmospheric conditions and runways.
<p>
The glider comes with operating landing gear, nose cone docking port, airlock door, deploy­able radiator and animated aerodynamic control surfaces. It now supports particle exhaust effects.
