<h1>Animation settings</h1>
Clicking the <i>Animation</i> button on the Scenario Editor's main <i>Vessel Edit</i> page opens the Delta-glider animation settings page. Here you can set the state of the various moving parts of the glider:
<p>
<b>Landing gear</b>: Set the undercarriage to lowered or retracted state.
<p>
<b>Retro doors</b>: Open or close the covers protecting the retro thrusters in the leading edges of the glider's wings. The retros will be disabled unless the covers are fully open.
<p>
<b>Outer airlock</b>: Open or close the outer airlock.
<p>
<b>Inner airlock</b>: Open or close the inner airlock.
<p>
<b>Nose cone</b>: Open or close the glider's nose cone to expose or cover the docking mechanism and airlock.
<p>
<b>Escape ladder</b>: Extend or stow the escape ladder for access of the airlock from the ground. The ladder can only be extended if the nose cone is open, and will automatically be stowed when the nose cone is closed.
<p>
<b>Top hatch</b>: Open or close the hatch in the cabin roof.
<p>
<b>Radiator</b>: Extend or stow the radiator panels in the rear of the glider's fuselage.
