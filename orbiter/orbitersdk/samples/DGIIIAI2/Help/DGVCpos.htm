<h1>Moving between VC positions</h1>
<p>The default virtual cockpit position places you in the pilot’s seat, behind the pane of the head-up display and with access to all instruments and flight controls. You can however also switch your position to any of the 4 passenger seats in the cabin, for example to experience the replay of a re-corded flight from a passenger’s perspective.</p>
<p>To switch to a different VC position, use Ctrl-arrow key combinations. The picture illustrates the different jump paths.
